Don McLean Says ‘American Pie’ Is Partly a Children’s Song

He reflects on success of 1971 anthem on 'The Big Interview' with Dan Rather.

Don McLean admitted he didn’t fully understand the success of his 1971 song “American Pie,” but said it might stem from the fact that it’s partly a children’s song. While he referred to the 1959 plane crash that killed Buddy Holly, Ritchie Valens and the Big Bopper – the tragedy came to be known as “the day the music died” – McLean said his principal inspiration was another shocking moment that took place four years later. On the latest edition of The Big Interview on AXS TV, host Dan Rather asked about the song having become a “cultural flash point” about “what was perceived to be the decline of America.” “Well, I was seeing that,” McLean replied. “To me, when [President] Kennedy was killed, all bets were off. It was a much bigger event than 9/11, which was a huge event. It was the beginning of Americans being in doubt about what they believed in and who they were. That was huge.” He argued that an “anything goes philosophy” had established itself over the years, to the point that the U.S. lived in a state of “decadence” today. “Civility has disappeared,” he noted. “I’m a crazy guy. I can be a hundred different people, but I like civility.”
