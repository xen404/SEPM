COVID-19 Roundup: Virus Turned Alice Cooper Positive

Rock legend talks about his new single, as Bruce Kulick, the Pretenders and Elvis Presley's estate react to coronavirus pandemic.

Alice Cooper said the coronavirus pandemic has presented the opportunity for him to write a positive song for the character he plays onstage. Cooper released “Don’t Give Up” last week. The video opens with an uplifting monologue by Cooper and is accompanied by clips contributed by fans. “This song was totally born out of consequence,” he said in a new video message. “No one expected the whole world to be stopped by a microscopic germ. And I thought it was time that Alice write a song that was encouraging.” He added that "it's a scary world right now, and we've lost a lot of people and a lot of people have been sick, and we've just seen how helpless we can be. And my idea was encouragement — we're stronger than this thing. We're tougher than that; we're the human race. So, don't fear it. Don't give up. Keep fighting. To me, that was the whole idea of the song. Let's not step off the ledge. Let's all be on the same game here. And at the same time, we'll beat it. It just takes time — that's all.”
